class CameraManager:
  """
  Singleton class for managing all active cameras in the system.

  The CameraManager is responsible for:
  - Initializing and maintaining a pool of camera objects.
  - Starting and stopping all camera-related processing threads (e.g., reading, detection).
  - Managing resources such as detection workers and saver threads.

  This class follows the Singleton design pattern to ensure only one instance exists
  throughout the application lifecycle. Use `CameraManager.get_instance()` to retrieve 
  the active instance after initialization.

  Attributes:
    camera_pool (dict): A mapping of camera_id to camera instance and its associated threads.
    db (psycopg2.extensions.connection): Active PostgreSQL database connection.
    detection_manager (DetectionManager): Manager for coordinating GPU detection workers.
    saver (Saver): Thread responsible for saving detection results.
