def read_frames(context: Camera):
    """
    Continuously reads frames from a camera source (IP camera or local webcam) and enqueues them for preprocessing.

    Implements reconnection logic with exponential backoff for IP cameras when frame reading fails repeatedly.

    Parameters:
        context (Camera): A Camera object containing camera configuration and state, including:
            - use_ip_camera (bool): Whether to use an IP camera (True) or local webcam (False, for testing only).
            - ip_address (str): IP address of the IP camera.
            - channel (str): Channel for the IP camera.
            - running (threading.Event): Event flag controlling the reading loop.
            - cap (cv2.VideoCapture): OpenCV video capture object.
            - manager (CameraManager): Reference to the central manager, to access shared queues.
            - frame_queue (queue.Queue): Local queue for buffering frames.
    
    Behavior:
        - Opens video capture based on whether IP camera or webcam is used.
        - Reads frames in a loop while the `running` event is set.
        - On frame read failure, counts consecutive failures.
        - For IP cameras, attempts to reconnect after multiple failures with exponential backoff.
        - Successfully read frames are put into the preprocessing queue of the manager.
        - Releases video capture on termination.
