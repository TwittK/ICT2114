def read_frames(context: Camera):
    """
    Reads frames from an IP camera or webcam and handles reconnections in case of failure.

    This function runs in a thread that continuously reads frames from the camera and handles connection issues by
    attempting to reconnect if frames cannot be retrieved. If the camera is an IP camera, it uses
    RTSP to stream frames, and it supports retries up to a maximum number of attempts with exponential backoff if consecutive failures occur.
    For non-IP cameras such as a local webcam, it directly captures frames (Use webcam only for testing on personal machines).

    Parameters:
        context (Camera): The camera context, containing configuration and state information about
                           the camera, such as whether it is an IP camera, its IP address, channel,
                           and the frame queue for processing.

    Notes:
        - For IP cameras, the function uses RTSP for video streaming with basic authentication.
        - The function uses exponential backoff for retrying failed connections, gradually increasing the
          delay between each reconnection attempt.
        - The function supports a maximum retry limit to prevent endless retries and control the backoff behavior.
